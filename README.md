# AI-Generated-Comic-Book-Storybook-Creator
This project integrates LLMs and ComfyUI to generate AI-powered comic books or illustrated storybooks. The idea is to have an LLM write a compelling story while ComfyUI generates corresponding illustrations, resulting in a fully AI-created book.
How It Works
Story Generation with LLM

The user provides a prompt (e.g., "A sci-fi adventure about a lost robot on Mars").

The LLM generates a structured story, including character descriptions, settings, and dialogues.

It can also break the story into scenes or panels for the comic format.

Image Generation with ComfyUI

Each scene or comic panel is processed into an image prompt for ComfyUI.

ComfyUI generates corresponding visuals for characters, backgrounds, and dynamic moments.

Additional styling options can be included, such as manga, watercolor, or cyberpunk themes.

Story Integration & Formatting

The images and text are combined into a comic or storybook format.

Tools like Canva, Adobe InDesign, or LaTeX can be used for formatting.

Optionally, AI-powered speech bubbles and dialogue enhancement can be added.

Features to Enhance the Project
User Input for Customization – Allow users to tweak character designs, color palettes, or illustration styles.

Voiceover & Audiobook Support – Convert the story into a narrated audiobook using AI voice models.

Interactive Comics – Implement an AI chatbot that lets users influence the story dynamically.

Text-to-Animation – Extend the project by turning static images into short AI-generated animations.

Tech Stack
